# Purpose

Dadgum box scores is a collection of every UNC men's basketball box score since the 2003-04 season. Nothing else. Just box scores. Dadgum box scores.

I put this together because I was tried of navigating crappy sites and not finding what I wanted. It shouldn't be _that hard_ to find a box score. It should be fast, easy, and organized. 

Curious how many minutes Raymond Felton played in [triple-overtime against Wake Forest](/boxes/2004/wake-119-unc-114.txt) in 2003?

Or UNC's record in the [ACC Tournament Championship](/?filter=acc%20tournament%20championship) under Roy Williams? 

Or how many times [UNC has beaten Michigan State](/?filter=michigan%20state) in the last decade? 

Stop scouring different sites and wasting your time. Find any box score by season or opponent. Sort by wins or losses, location, conference or non-conference. And get exactly what you need without any headaches.

This site only has box scores. Every so often, I do share some observations and opinions here: [fyi.dadgumboxscores.com](https://fyi.dadgumboxscores.com). 

But this site doesn't include schedules, player interviews or news, or any other stats. If you're looking for other places to find information like that, here's a few site recommendations and people to follow.

## [Frequently Asked Questions](/purpose/#faq)

### What format are the box scores in?

All box scores are in txt or PDF format. This makes the box scores both human and machine readable.

### Why only box scores since the 2003-2004 season?

Couple reasons. First, the difficulty goes way up trying to find box scores prior to this date. Even finding box scores from the 03-04 season took some elbow grease.

Second, the cutoff date makes it a bit more current. This was Roy Williams first season, and it felt like a clean break and good starting point.

### Where do you pull the box scores from?

The most common places were collegiate athletic sites and publications, sites like [goheels.com](http://goheels.com) or [insidecarolina.com](http://insidecarolina.com). Google, ESPN, and CBS also were a big help.

### Can I use the box scores?

Yes. Feel free to print these box scores or link to them on your own sites or for your own research. If you want to refer to [dadgumboxscores.com](http://dadgumboxscores.com) as the source, you deserve a high-five.

### How do I share a specific filter or search? 

Add `?filter=YOURSEARCHTEAM` to the URL to share a filter or pre-filter the list of box scores. 

For example, if you wanted to share all box scores against Michigan State, add `?filter=michigan%20state` to the URL: [dadgumboxscores.com?filter=michigan%20state](http://dadgumboxscores.com?filter=michigan%20state)

### I found an error, what should I do next?

If you can't find something you're looking for or spot an typo, please let me know via email [here](mailto:cbbstatshelp@gmail.com).

I want this site to be as accurate as possible and would love your help.

### Who am I?

I'm [Chris Gallo](https://hotdogsandeggs.com). I put together this site because I wanted it to be easier to find old UNC box scores. 

I used to work in sports information, and find all kind of stats fascinating. If you're curious, I built another site to help folks learn and understand advanced stats for college hoops. Think of it as a KenPom for Dummies. Check it out at [cbbstatshelp.com](https://cbbstatshelp.com).

If you have any questions, please send me an [email here](mailto:cbbstatshelp@gmail.com).
