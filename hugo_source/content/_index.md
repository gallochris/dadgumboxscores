title: Dadgum Box Scores
---


Dadgum box scores is a collection of every UNC men's basketball box score since the 2003-04 season.

I put together this site because I wanted it to be easier to find old UNC box scores. I was tired of navigating crappy sites and not finding what I wanted. It shouldn’t be that hard to find a box score. It should be fast, easy, and organized.

## The Dadgum App 

You can find sortable data at the [dadgum app](https://dadgum.shinyapps.io/boxscores/), including: 

- officials: a list of all refs for every game since '03-04
- four factors: game-by-game numbers of the building blicks of effiency
- shooting data: game-by-game shooting stats since '03-04
- plots: some of this data can be used to generate charts or plots or graphs


This site doesn’t include schedules, player stats, or interviews. I’m not a reporter, and I’m not going to break any news.

## Why only data since the 2003-2004 season?

Couple reasons. First, the difficulty goes way up trying to find box scores prior to this date. Even finding box scores from the '03-04 season took some elbow grease.

Second, the cutoff date makes it a bit more current. This was Roy Williams first season, and it felt like a clean break and good starting point.
