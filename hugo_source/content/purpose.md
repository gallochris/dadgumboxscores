Dadgum Box Scores is a collection of every UNC men's basketball box score since the 2003-04 season.

Curious how many minutes Jawad Williams played in [triple-overtime against Wake Forest](/boxes/2004/wake-119-unc-114/) in 2003?

Or UNC's record in the [ACC Tournament Championship](/?filter=acc%20tournament%20championship) under Roy Williams? 

Or how many times [UNC has beaten Michigan State](/?filter=michigan%20state) in the last decade? 

Stop scouring different sites and wasting your time. Find any box score by season or opponent and get exactly what you need without any headaches.

**[Frequently Asked Questions](/purpose/#faq)**

**Are you still collecting box scores?**

Nope. This project is now archived as the Roy Williams Era has come to an end.

**What format are the box scores in?**

All box scores are in txt or PDF format. 

**Why only box scores since the 2003-2004 season?**

Couple reasons. First, the difficulty goes way up trying to find box scores prior to this date. Even finding box scores from the 03-04 season took some elbow grease.

Second, the cutoff date makes it a bit more current. This was Roy Williams first season, and it felt like a clean break and good starting point.

**Where did you pull the box scores from?**

The most common places were collegiate athletic sites and publications, sites like [goheels.com](http://goheels.com) or [insidecarolina.com](http://insidecarolina.com). Google, ESPN, and CBS also were a big help.

**Can I use the box scores?**

Yes. Feel free to print these box scores or link to them on your own sites or for your own research. If you want to refer to [dadgumboxscores.com](http://dadgumboxscores.com) as the source, you deserve a high-five.

**How do I share a specific filter or search?**

Add `?filter=YOURSEARCHTEAM` to the URL to share a filter or pre-filter the list of box scores. 

For example, if you wanted to share all box scores against Michigan State, add `?filter=michigan%20state` to the URL: [dadgumboxscores.com?filter=michigan%20state](http://dadgumboxscores.com?filter=michigan%20state)

**I found an error, what should I do next?**
