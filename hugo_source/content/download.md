In addition to box scores, I've collected a ton of game-by-game data for the entire Roy Williams Era.

You can [download the dataset](/download/dbs_full_dataset.csv) for all 648 games here.

The data is in CSV format. The dataset includes:

- four factors (offense and defense)
- shooting (offense and defense)
- referees for every game
- point spreads
- fouls

If you can't find something you're looking for or spot an typo, please let me know via email [here](mailto:chris@hellogallo.com).
